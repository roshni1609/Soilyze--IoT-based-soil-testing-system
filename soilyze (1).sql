Three types of planting systems are practiced: the setts may be planted on the flat, they may be planted in trenches or holes, or they may be planted on mounds, ridges or raised beds. The last method is the most widespread and the mounds can vary from about 50 cm high and perhaps twice as wide at the bottom, to nearly 100 cm high and twice this width at the base. In the smaller mounds one sett is normally planted and in the larger ones three or four, or even eight to ten setts. In general, larger mounds are preferred and the setts are planted in holes dug in the sides near the natural ground level. They are planted deeply to avoid drying out of the young shoots and for this reason the head of the sett is also placed downwards. Sometimes, instead of individual mounds, ridges are used and the setts are planted along the sides of the ridges. Planting on the flat is only practiced in areas such as river flood plains, where the soil is deep and soft. In this system, the setts are planted in holes just below the soil surface. Support for the growing vines is usually provided, most often stakes or trellises, or strings attached to horizontal ropes or trees, sometimes corn stalks left from an intercrop of maize, or even bushes: there is evidence indicating that such support is necessary for satisfactory plant and tuber development. However, a few cultivars, notably of D. alata and D. esculenta, are adapted to trailing on the ground without support, and in Barbados D. alata is cultivated, without staking, on the plantation scale. Recent work suggests that with close planting other species may also give satisfactory yields without support.\n\nPlanting is normally by hand, but a mechanical planter is now being used in Barbados. For optimum yields yams must be kept free from weeds, at least for the first three months of growth, and the following herbicides have been used successfully: diuron 2.6 kg/ha, together with TCA at 4.4 kg/ha, and atrazine at 1.5-2.9 kg/ha.\n\nTime of planting-yams are not normally grown under irrigation and in areas where the rains last 8-10 months planting normally takes place just before or at the beginning of the rains. Where the rainy season is less than 8 months it has been found that early planting, up to 3 months before the rains, can give a 30 per cent increase in yield.\n\nField spacing-a wide range of planting distances is used, depending upon the species, the soil type and the water table and whether intercropping is practiced; mounds are often irregularly spaced and planting distances ranging from 0.7 to 2.3 m2 have been reported. Generally, the wider the spacing the lower the yield and common spacings are 1.2 x 1.2 m, 1.2x0.9 m and 1.8x0.6 m.\n\nSeed rate-the number of setts used obviously varies according to the species and the cultivar, but for most large-tubered yams 10 000-15 000/ha are used, requiring at least 2.5 t/ha of setts.', 'Nitrogen,Phosphorous,Pottasium', 'https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/19293', 'whiteyam.jpeg'),
